To compile and execute a C program on a Linux system, you typically use a series of commands in the terminal. Here are the steps:

1. Open the Terminal

    You can usually open the terminal from your application menu or by using a shortcut like Ctrl+Alt+T.

2. Navigate to the Directory

    Use the cd (change directory) command to navigate to the directory where your C file is located.

3. Compile the C Program

    Use the gcc (GNU Compiler Collection) command to compile your C file.

    gcc -o outputfile inputfile.c

eg: gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c

4. Check for Compilation Errors

    If there are errors in your code, gcc will display them. You'll need to fix these errors in your C file and recompile.

5. Execute the Compiled Program

    Use the ./ (current directory) prefix to run the compiled program.
    eg: ./myprogram
6. Optional: Clean Up

    If you want to remove the compiled executable file, you can use the rm command.
    eg: rm myprogram
